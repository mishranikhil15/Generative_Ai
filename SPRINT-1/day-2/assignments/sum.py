# Write a Python program that calculates and prints the sum and average of a list of numbers.

# Input list of numbers
numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40]

# Calculate the sum of the numbers
sum_of_numbers = sum(numbers)

# Calculate the average of the numbers
average_of_numbers = sum_of_numbers / len(numbers)

# Print the sum and average
print("Sum:", sum_of_numbers)
print("Average:", average_of_numbers)
