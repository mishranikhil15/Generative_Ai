**Problem 3:**

- **Prerequisite**: Understand basic data fetching in SQL / MongoDB
- **Problem**: Write a query to fetch all data from the **`Customers`** table / collection.

To fetch all data from the Customers table in SQL, you can use the following query:

SELECT * FROM Customers;

In MongoDB, to fetch all data from the Customers collection, you can use the find() method without any parameters:

db.Customers.find();
